# Physiological protein homodimers Benchmark

## Structure

* `pdbs`: folder containing for a given version (i.e. `v2`) all the PDB structures ready.
* `prediction`: prediction files for each of the methods benchmarked.

### Files

* `pdbs/v2/complex.list`: list of all complexes in the benchmark
* `pdbs/v2/physiological.list`: all complexes classified as physiological
* `pdbs/v2/nonphysiological.list`: all complexes classified as non-physiological
* `pdbs/v2/error.list`: Errors found on PDB structures which have been manually curated.
