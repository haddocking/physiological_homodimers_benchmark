Deeprank was run on Haddock refined models
The protocol used is discribed in : https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.29.425727v1.full

Most of the pssm matrices were downloaded from the 3Dcons database, the other ones were generated with PSSMgen from Deeprank (https://github.com/DeepRank/PSSMGen)

Different problems were met and required manual edition of the PDB files:
- mulitple atom occupancy are not handled by deeprank, should select one
- the chain 1 must come first in the pdb file. if chain1 = 'A' then A should be the first chain
- inconsistency between the residue numbering in the pssm matrix and the pdb file (use pdb_reres.py from PDBTools to correct that)
- remove HETATM (grep ATOM ${name}.pdb > tmp)
- remove CRO and ACE residue (grep ATOM ${name}.pdb | grep -v ACE | grep -v CRO > tmp)
- replace MSE -> MET (sed -i 's/MSE/MET/g' tmp)
- make sure the line's lenght do not exceed 80 characters (pdb2sql issue, may have been solved) (fold -b80 tmp > ${name}.pdb)

There pre-trained model was used for the prediction part.

Prediction fails for 7 dimers:
- 3kza_1 - grids were generated - deeprank prediction failed
- 3l0z_5 - grids were generated - deeprank prediction failed
- 5xo7_1 - no pssm could be computed
- 6vdd_2 - no pssm could be computed
- 6vjb_4 - no pssm could be computed
- 6w25_2 - no pssm could be computed
- 6wrh_3 - no pssm could be computed
